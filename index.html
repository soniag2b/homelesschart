  <p>With the recent migrant buses arriving in New York City, organizations helping the homeless and others in need are facing a rise in demand, and at least one mid-town group has for the time in its 33-year history had to turn people unfed due to a lack of supplies.</p>
<p>
“About 20 new families come each week,” says Angela Wood, who started volunteering at Crossroads shortly after moving from the UK a year and a half ago. “It feels good to know we are helping people,” she says, serving breakfast with a team of five. </p>
<p>
More than 20,000 migrants have arrived in the city over the past six months, travelling from Texas, according to a report in The New York Times. </p>
<p>
For Crossroads, the increase amongst their guests is predominantly women and immigrants.</p>

<p>Founded in 1989 to fight hunger and homelessness, Crossroads serves meals and distributes groceries to those in need in New York City, seven days a week. With a paid staff of four and volunteers to help with food preparation and service, the charity reports an increase in demand of around 20% across various programs since a year ago. </p>

<p>This increase becomes difficult to match by resources, forcing the organization to report in a statement October 26, that “for the first time in memory, [we] were unable to keep up with demand, and had to send people away.” </p>

<p>Jesse Ramos, Crossroads’ executive director, commented on the increase in demand saying that “the recent wave of immigrants has been sent to us” by social workers and other associations. </p>

<p>For 2022, Crossroads has an annual budget of $805,500. Ramos explained that 10 percent of the organization’s budget comes from the City and State of New York, 52 percent from corporations and foundations, and 38 percent from individual donors. </p>

<p>The challenge, he explained, is that part of the donations is restricted, meaning that it can only be used to buy food. The City and State contribution also comes in part in food credit. Ramos says that he has administrative expenses including utilities, repairs, salaries but also utensils, boxes, napkins, bags, and cups, which are increasingly hard to cover. </p>

<p>As the association prepares more and more meals, the need for unrestricted money increases.</p>

<p>Already in 2016, 12.5 percent of people experiencing homelessness in the US were in New York City, according to City University of New York professor Thomas J. Main, in his book Homelessness in New York City: Policymaking from Koch to de Blasio. New Yorkers account for around 2 percent of the national population.</p>

<p>Main retraced the history of response to homeless as three successive periods from the implementation of the “right to shelter” in the 1980s, then in the 1990s a period where shelter was contingent to working or seeking treatment and in the early 2000s when Mayor Michael Bloomberg wanted to solve homelessness through permanent housing. However, the funding was cut very early.</p>

<div class="explain">
  <p>The percentage change of sheltered individuals as well as total homeless budget spent shows a strong increase according to the data from the US department of Housing and Urban Development and the New York City’s Independent Budget Office. The amount spent per individual has been stagnant or even decreased until 2017. In 2021, it shows an increase of 100% compared to 2005.</p>

<p>Crossroads serves breakfast three times a week, a Saturday brunch, and dinners every evening. It also runs a food pantry once a week. At the end of September 2022, the charity had served more than 182,000 meals across all programs. </p>

<p>For the breakfast program, cooks arrive 5:30am to prepare the food. At 6:30am, the service team starts laying out the items so to-go bags can be assembled at the last minute, including a hot meal. </p>

<p>At 7:00am, a line begins to form at the front door, with the service starting at 7:30am. A table is set outside: one volunteer takes the orders, one prepares the coffee, and one hands the bags to the guests. </p>

<p>Inside, four volunteers keep assembling the items so there are always about 15 bags ready to be served. And one volunteer acts as the captain, helping the whole process to run smoothly.</p>

<p>Will, 41, a volunteer at Crossroads, explains that he “likes to give, and this is [his] community.” Will lives in the neighborhood and comes twice a week to hand out breakfast and coffee, before going to work at 9:30 am.</p>

<p>On Wednesday mornings, Jack Huston is the captain. He has been volunteering at Crossroads for 10 years. </p>

<p> “Crossroads has always had the aspiration to make the food better, to improve,” he explained. “We offer a vegetarian option. People may think that because our guests are poor, they should not be picky. There are many reasons why one, even poor, would need a vegetarian option:  health and religion are two of them.” </p>

<p>Huston also noted that the recent increase in demand is very visible.</p>

<p>Martha Avery, the staff administrator and grant writer for Crossroads, moved from Chicago to New York City in 2019 and joined with her husband as volunteers in January 2020. They have always volunteered, so joining Crossroads was natural for them. </p>

<p>On Wednesday, Avery was on the sidewalk, welcoming guests and taking their orders. She explained that “some are unemployed, some are homeless, and others have a job but cannot afford food once they have fed their children.” </p>

<p>Crossroads has a donation page on their website, here, where anyone can contribute to help combat hunger in New York City. The charity also always welcomes new volunteers, and can be reached on its contact page, here.</p>

<p>Comments from the Comptroller Office as well as from the Coalition for the Homeless have been requested: the story will be updated when received.</p>
